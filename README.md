# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Random Forest and Streamlit

## Overview
This project is a **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** system built using the **Random Forest Classifier**. It includes a **Streamlit-based web application** where users can input text and instantly receive sentiment predictions such as **positive**, **negative**, **neutral**, or **irrelevant**. 

The project demonstrates a robust data processing pipeline, machine learning model training, and a user-friendly front-end interface.

---

## Key Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies tweets into Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Irrelevant categories.
- **Interactive Web App**: A Streamlit application for real-time sentiment prediction.
- **Random Forest Algorithm**:
  - Highly accurate and robust to noise and outliers.
  - Utilizes ensemble learning for better performance.
  - Scikit-learn implementation for simplicity and scalability.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Word cloud generation to highlight frequent words.
  - Distribution plots for feature insights.

---

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Uses Twitter sentiment data from a CSV file available in the GitHub repository.
   - Preprocessed to clean missing or irrelevant information.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Removal of stopwords, hashtags, and special characters using `preprocess_kgp_talkie` library.
   - Basic feature extraction: word count, character count, and sentiment label distribution.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized feature distributions across sentiment categories.
   - Highlighted patterns like word frequency and sentiment density.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Leveraged Random Forest Classifier with tuned hyperparameters.
   - Ensured scalability and avoided overfitting through randomized tree construction.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Integrated the model into a **Streamlit application**.
   - Enabled real-time sentiment predictions.
